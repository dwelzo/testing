 **how real-time professional testers actually test software — from the very first step to the last**, in *pin-point, practical sequence*.

Here’s the **complete step-by-step breakdown (industry real-world flow)** 👇

---

## 🧩 1. **Requirement Analysis (First Step)**

**Goal:** Understand *what* to test.

**Pin-points:**

* Tester reads **Software Requirement Specification (SRS)** or **User Stories (JIRA, ClickUp, Azure, etc.)**
* Discusses with Business Analyst & Developer: *“What does this feature do?”*
* Identifies **testable requirements** (functional, UI, performance, security).
* Creates a **Requirement Traceability Matrix (RTM)** — maps every requirement → test case.

🧠 *Outcome:* Tester knows exactly what needs to be verified.

---

## 🧪 2. **Test Planning**

**Goal:** Define *how* testing will be done.

**Pin-points:**

* Prepare a **Test Plan Document** with:

  * Scope (what to test, what not)
  * Test strategy (manual / automation / performance)
  * Resources (testers, environments)
  * Tools (JIRA, TestRail, Selenium, Postman, etc.)
  * Risk assessment & mitigation
* Get approval from QA Lead / Manager.

🧠 *Outcome:* A roadmap for the entire testing process.

---

## 🧰 3. **Test Case Design / Test Scenario Writing**

**Goal:** Write *clear steps to validate functionality.*

**Pin-points:**

* Write **test scenarios** (high-level flows) — e.g. “Login functionality.”
* Write **test cases** — e.g.:

  * Step 1: Go to login page
  * Step 2: Enter valid username/password
  * Step 3: Click Login
  * Expected Result: User dashboard opens
* Include **positive**, **negative**, **boundary**, **edge**, **error-handling** cases.
* Review test cases with peers.

🧠 *Outcome:* Reusable, detailed test coverage for each feature.

---

## 🧭 4. **Test Environment Setup**

**Goal:** Create a safe, isolated setup for testing.

**Pin-points:**

* QA team sets up:

  * Test server (backend APIs, DB)
  * Test frontend build (e.g., staging website)
  * Test data (seed users, properties, etc.)
* Ensure connectivity (DB, services, mock APIs).
* Verify environment = stable before testing.

🧠 *Outcome:* Controlled sandbox for execution.

---

## 🧍‍♂️ 5. **Test Execution (Core Step)**

**Goal:** Actually perform the tests.

**Pin-points:**

* Execute manual test cases (via TestRail, Zephyr, Excel).
* Mark each case:

  * ✅ Pass
  * ❌ Fail
  * ⚙️ Blocked (waiting for fix)
* Log **bugs/defects** in tool (JIRA, GitHub Issues):

  * Steps to reproduce
  * Expected vs Actual result
  * Screenshots, logs, severity, priority
* For automation testers:

  * Write & run scripts (Selenium, Cypress, Playwright, Pytest).
  * Integrate into CI/CD (Jenkins, GitHub Actions).

🧠 *Outcome:* Bugs discovered and reported precisely.

---

## 🧩 6. **Defect Tracking & Retesting**

**Goal:** Ensure every bug is fixed correctly.

**Pin-points:**

* Developer fixes the bug → marks as “Ready for Retest.”
* Tester re-tests the same case.
* If fixed → close bug.
* If not → reopen and attach proof (screenshots, logs).

🧠 *Outcome:* Verified bug fixes; regression starts.

---

## 🔁 7. **Regression Testing**

**Goal:** Check that old features didn’t break.

**Pin-points:**

* Re-run previously passed test cases.
* Use automation if available.
* Prioritize critical flows (e.g., Login, Checkout, Property Search).

🧠 *Outcome:* System remains stable after changes.

---

## 📈 8. **UAT (User Acceptance Testing)**

**Goal:** Validate from *end-user/business* perspective.

**Pin-points:**

* Real business users test features in **UAT environment**.
* Tester assists them, tracks UAT defects.
* Product Owner signs off → “Go Live.”

🧠 *Outcome:* Confirmation that product meets business needs.

---

## 🚀 9. **Test Closure (Last Step)**

**Goal:** Officially end testing phase.

**Pin-points:**

* QA Lead prepares **Test Closure Report**:

  * Total test cases executed
  * Pass/Fail count
  * Outstanding defects
  * Lessons learned
* Conduct retrospective (what went well, what didn’t).

🧠 *Outcome:* QA phase formally completed; product ready for production.

**step-by-step — just like a real QA tester working in a company like yours (Dwelzo)**, testing a *Property Posting Form* end-to-end.
I’ll show you how it happens in **real-time**, from requirement to bug fix, using actual QA practices.

---

## 🧩 **Scenario:** “Post Property Form” (Sell → Residential)

### 🧠 Requirement (From JIRA ticket)

> As a registered user,
> I should be able to **post my property for sale**,
> so that buyers can view it on the Dwelzo platform.

**Fields:**

* Title (text)
* Category: Residential / Commercial
* Subtype: Apartment / Villa / Plot
* Price (numeric, required)
* State → City → Area dropdowns
* Image Upload (optional)
* Submit Button

---

## 🧭 **STEP 1 — Requirement Analysis**

Tester reads the **JIRA ticket** and notes:

* Field-level validations
* Mandatory vs optional
* Dependencies (category → subtype)

📋 **Checklist:**

* Are error messages defined?
* What happens if price = 0?
* Is login required to access this page?

✅ *Output:* Requirement Traceability Matrix (RTM)

| Requirement            | Test ID | Test Case                       |
| ---------------------- | ------- | ------------------------------- |
| User must be logged in | TC001   | Verify login redirect           |
| Title required         | TC002   | Leave title blank, click Submit |
| Price > 0              | TC003   | Enter 0 and click Submit        |
| Image optional         | TC004   | Submit without image            |

---

## 🧪 **STEP 2 — Test Case Writing**

Tester writes **manual test cases** in TestRail or Excel.

| TC ID | Description                           | Steps                                | Expected Result                                 |
| ----- | ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------- |
| TC001 | Verify user must login before posting | Visit `/post-property` without login | Redirects to `/login`                           |
| TC002 | Verify title is mandatory             | Leave title blank → Submit           | Shows “Title is required”                       |
| TC003 | Verify price cannot be 0              | Enter price 0 → Submit               | Shows “Price must be greater than 0”            |
| TC004 | Verify valid submission               | Fill all fields correctly → Submit   | Success message “Property created successfully” |

✅ *Output:* Approved test cases ready for execution.

---

## ⚙️ **STEP 3 — Test Environment Setup**

Tester ensures:

* Backend FastAPI (GraphQL) is running: `http://api.dwelzo.local/graphql`
* Frontend Next.js is built for `staging.dwelzo.local`
* Database seeded with test data (States, Cities)
* Logged in as `qa_user@test.com`

✅ *Output:* Ready to test on a **staging environment**.

---

## 🧍‍♂️ **STEP 4 — Test Execution**

Tester opens the UI, starts executing cases one by one.

### 🔹 **TC003 Execution:**

1. Go to “Sell Property” form
2. Enter title = “My Villa”
3. Price = `0`
4. Category = “Residential” → Subtype = “Villa”
5. Submit

**Actual Result:** Form accepts 0 and posts successfully 😱
**Expected Result:** Should show “Price must be greater than 0.”

❌ **Test Result:** FAIL

📸 Tester takes screenshot of the success toast and logs bug in JIRA.

---

## 🐞 **STEP 5 — Defect Logging**

**JIRA Ticket:**

```
Title: Property form accepts zero price (validation missing)
Project: DWELZO-TEST
Environment: Staging
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to /post-property
2. Fill all fields, enter price 0
3. Click Submit
Expected: Validation message “Price must be greater than 0”
Actual: Property created successfully.
Severity: Major
Priority: High
Attachments: Screenshot + console log
Status: Open
```

✅ *Output:* Bug created and assigned to developer.

---

## 🧑‍💻 **STEP 6 — Developer Fix**

Backend developer adds this check in FastAPI:

```python
if input.price <= 0:
    raise ValueError("Price must be greater than 0")
```

GraphQL mutation now returns an error response for invalid price.

They push the fix → QA gets notification: “Ready for Retest.”

---

## 🔁 **STEP 7 — Retesting**

Tester re-runs **TC003**:

* Enter price `0`
* Submit
  ✅ **Now validation error shown:** *“Price must be greater than 0.”*

🎯 Result: PASS
Bug closed in JIRA with resolution *Fixed.*

---

## 🧩 **STEP 8 — Regression Testing**

QA re-runs all previously passed test cases (TC001, TC002, TC004)
to make sure the new validation didn’t break anything else.

All PASS ✅

---

## 📈 **STEP 9 — Test Closure (Final Step)**

Tester prepares **Test Summary Report** for the sprint.

| Metric           | Count                        |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Total Test Cases | 25                           |
