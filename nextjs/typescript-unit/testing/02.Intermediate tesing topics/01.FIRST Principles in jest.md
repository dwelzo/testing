### What is Jest?
At its core, Jest is a JavaScript testing framework that helps you:

-   Write tests that check if your code behaves correctly.

-  Run those tests automatically.

-   Give you clear feedback (pass/fail, coverage, performance).

It’s created by Meta (Facebook) and works especially well with React, but it’s framework-agnostic — you can use it with plain JS, TypeScript, Node, or any frontend library.


Perfect 👏 — you’re referring to the **F.I.R.S.T. principles** of **unit testing**, which define *what good tests should look like*.

Let’s go through each principle clearly and practically, especially in the **context of Jest** 🧪.

##  **F.I.R.S.T. Principles of Testing**

> These are **guidelines (principles)** — not strict rules — that help you write clean, reliable, and maintainable tests.

---

###  1️⃣ **F — Fast**

> **Tests should run quickly.**

* **Why:**
  If your test suite is slow, you’ll run it less often — and that defeats the purpose of testing early and frequently.

* **How to achieve in Jest:**

  * Keep **unit tests small and focused** (test a single function).
  * Use **mocks** instead of real databases or APIs.
  * Run Jest in **watch mode**:

    ```bash
    npx jest --watch
    ```
  * Use **parallel testing** (Jest does this by default).

 *Example:*

```ts
test('adds numbers fast', () => {
  expect(1 + 2).toBe(3);
});
```

 *Avoid:*
Tests that wait for network calls, file reads, or long computations.

---

###  2 **I — Independent**

> **Tests should not depend on each other.**

* **Why:**
  If one test fails, others shouldn’t be affected.
  Independence ensures predictable, consistent results.

* **How to achieve in Jest:**

  * Never share mutable global state between tests.
  * Use `beforeEach()` or `afterEach()` to **reset setup**.
  * Each test should **set up its own data**.

 *Example:*

```ts
let counter = 0;

beforeEach(() => {
  counter = 0;
});

test('increment counter', () => {
  counter++;
  expect(counter).toBe(1);
});

test('decrement counter', () => {
  counter--;
  expect(counter).toBe(-1);
});
```

 *Avoid:*
Tests that rely on data created in previous tests.

---

### 🔁 3️⃣ **R — Repeatable**

> **Tests should produce the same result every time**, no matter when or where they run.

* **Why:**
  Flaky tests (that pass sometimes and fail other times) destroy trust in your test suite.

* **How to achieve in Jest:**

  * Avoid depending on external systems (network, random numbers, time).
  * Use mocks for non-deterministic values (e.g., `Date.now()`, `Math.random()`).
  * Control test data inputs explicitly.

 *Example:*

```ts
jest.useFakeTimers().setSystemTime(new Date('2025-01-01'));

test('returns today’s date', () => {
  expect(getToday()).toBe('2025-01-01');
});
```

 *Avoid:*
Tests that depend on current time, system locale, or API responses.

---

###  4️ **S — Self-validating**

> **A test should automatically tell you if it passes or fails** — no manual checking.

* **Why:**
  Tests should have clear, binary results:  pass or ❌ fail.

* **How to achieve in Jest:**

  * Always use **assertions** (`expect(...)`).
  * Never rely on console logs to verify outcomes.

 *Example:*

```ts
test('sum adds correctly', () => {
  expect(sum(2, 3)).toBe(5);
});
```

 *Avoid:*

```ts
test('sum adds correctly', () => {
  console.log(sum(2, 3)); // ❌ requires human to read output
});
```

---

### 🔍 5️ **T — Thorough (or Timely)**

>  **Thorough:** Cover all important cases (happy paths + edge cases).
> ⏱️ **Timely:** Write tests *early*, ideally *before* or *with* the code (TDD mindset).

* **Why:**
  Thorough tests improve confidence.
  Timely tests prevent bugs from ever reaching production.

* **How to achieve in Jest:**

  * Write **test cases for each branch** of logic.
  * Use **parameterized tests** (`test.each`).
  * Include **error conditions** and **boundary values**.

 *Example:*

```ts
import { divide } from './math';

test.each([
  [10, 2, 5],
  [-10, 2, -5],
])('divides %i by %i = %i', (a, b, expected) => {
  expect(divide(a, b)).toBe(expected);
});

test('throws when dividing by zero', () => {
  expect(() => divide(10, 0)).toThrow('Cannot divide by zero');
});
```

| --------- | ----------------- | ---------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| **F**     | Fast              | Small, quick functions | Slow DB/API calls                       |
| **I**     | Independent       | Reset state each test  | Shared globals                          |
| **R**     | Repeatable        | Mock random/time       | Depend on environment                   |
| **S**     | Self-validating   | Use `expect()`         | Use `console.log`                       |
| **T**     | Thorough / Timely | Test all cases early   | Write tests late or only for happy path |
